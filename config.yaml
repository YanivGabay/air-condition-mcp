    USER SLEEP STYLE:
    - I sleep WITH a פוך (duvet/blanket)
    - Studies show 18°C is ideal for deep sleep with blanket
    - Target room temp: 16-20°C
    - I wake up around 06:30

    AGGRESSIVE COOLING RULES:
    - If room > 20°C: ACTIVELY COOL to reach 16-20°C optimal range!
    - If room 16-20°C: Perfect, no action needed
    - If room < 16°C: Too cold, need heating

    IMPORTANT: Don't wait until room is >24°C to cool. Start cooling when above 20°C!
