# Air Condition Automation Config
# ================================

room:
  layout: |
    SENSOR PLACEMENT: On desk with electronics (screens, laptop) - reads 2-3°C HIGHER than actual bed area
    AC POSITION: Directly above bed - cold air blows on user when cooling
    WINDOW: Same wall as AC - lets cold in during winter

    WHAT THIS MEANS:
    - If sensor shows 20°C, user actually feels ~17-18°C at bed
    - Running AC cooling makes user VERY COLD (direct airflow + already cold)
    - In winter with outside <15°C, AC cooling is almost never needed

  # Sleep science based ranges (with blanket)
