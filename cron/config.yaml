    USER SLEEP STYLE:
    - I sleep WITH a blanket/cover
    - Optimal room temp for blanket sleeping: 16-20°C
    - I wake up around 06:30

    DECISION RULES:
    - If room > 24°C: Too hot, need cooling
    - If room 20-24°C: Comfortable, probably no AC needed
    - If room 16-20°C: Optimal for blanket sleeping
    - If room < 16°C: Too cold, might need heating

    ENERGY SAVING:
    - If outside is cold and room is comfortable, turn AC OFF
    - Prefer "none" action when room is in acceptable range
    - Only use AC when truly needed
